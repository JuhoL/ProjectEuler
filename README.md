This is a personal repository for Project Euler solutions.
Since GitHub requires monthly payment to make private hidden repositories, this is publicly availabe.

If you are interested in solving mathematical programming problems, DO NOT PEEK INTO THESE FILES!
If you are not familiar with Project Euler, take a look at their website first at http://projecteuler.net
If the problems seem interesting, ignore this repo and go solve the problems yourself - It will be an enlightening experience.

If you are currently working on Project Euler problems and for some strange reason you want to cheat by copy-pasting my solutions,
I'd like to remind that if you are going to do art forgery it is wiser to make a frogery of Rembrandt that a drawing of
a nine-year-old Johnny. My repo is the latter, since I'm not a mathematician.

So, in a nut-shell:
1. If you are interested in Project Euler and are perhaps already workingo n the problems, GO AWAY! You'll ruin the fun.
2. Iy tou are interested in Project Euler and want to copy-paste solutions like a lousy dog that you are, GO AWAY! There are much better solutions available.
3. If you cannot be arsed less about Project Euler, GO AWAY! I don't know what you are doing in here in the first place.
4. If you have already solved the problems and want to take a look at how others have solved the problems, then feel free to rummage around.
