# Project Euler Problem 42: "Coded triangle numbers"
# 
# The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first
# ten triangle numbers are:
# 
# 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
# 
# By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position
# and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is
# 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word
# a triangle word.
# 
# Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing
# nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?
